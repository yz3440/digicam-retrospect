Digital cameras uses electronic image sensors to capture light. Therefore, the technology behind
the
<b>image sensor</b> is crucial for better image quality.

Over the past decades, digital cameras benefit from advanced electronic manufacturing. As
semiconductors get smaller, more pixels can be packed into a single sensor, resulting in a
sharper
and clearer image.

<b style='color:green'>CMOS <sub>(Complementary Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor)</sub></b>
<p>The <span style='color:green'>CMOS</span> sensor technology is increasingly being used in today's cameras, allowing users to shoot 1080p video and apply complex imaging effects with ease.</p>
<b style='color:skyblue'>CCD <sub>(Charge-Coupled Device)</sub></b>
<p>Traditionally, <span style='color:skyblue'>CCD</span> sensors have been thought to produce better-looking images with less visual noise and distortion, but they draw more power and provide slower data-throughput speed.</p>

A <b>Full-Frame</b> digital camera is one with an image sensor format that
is the same size as <b>35 mm format film</b>.
</p>
<img src="assets/film.jpg" width='200px'>
<p>
Historically, 35 mm was considered a small
film format compared with medium format, large format and even larger. However, due to high
defect
rate of larger digital image sensor, <b>smaller form factors</b> are much more commonly seen.
</p>
<p>
If under the same glass, smaller sensors cover a <b>smaller field of view</b> and thus a
<b>magnified perspective</b>.

Without doubt, more sphisticated cameras with <span style='color:#1C415A'><b>Interchangeable Lens

sensors for quality lens families.

<p>
Manufacturers prefer small sensors for cameras with a <span style='color:#ED6168'><b>Built-In Lens
        System</b></span>. Besides cost saving in the low-end market, the optical system is also a
consideration. Since smaller sensors crop out the edges and enlarge the center of the frame, the
zoom range of a lens expands as well.
</p>

<p>
For example, a light-weight zoom lens (4-20mm) on a <b>1-inch</b> sensor could covers the same range
of a
heavy zoom (24-120mm) on a <b>Full-Frame</b> sensor.
